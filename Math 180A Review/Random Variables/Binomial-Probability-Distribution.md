# Binomial Probability Distribution

Situations involving a series of independent and identical trials. Each trial can only have one of two possible outcomes.

Consider a series of $n$ independent trials, each resulting in one of two possible outcomes, "success" or "failure."  

Let $p = P$ (success occurs at any given trial) and assume that $p$ remains constant from trial to trial.  Then

$$P(\text{$k$ successes}) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, \quad k = 0, 1, \cdots, n$$

Let the random variable $X$ denote the number of successes in $n$ independent trials, then  

$$P(X=k) = p_X (k) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, \quad k = 0, 1, \cdots , n$$
